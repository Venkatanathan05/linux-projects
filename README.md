# 100xDev web-dev projects

This repository stores the web-dev projects that come under the 100xdev curriculum.

I have taken an initiative of going through this course completely in a linux based enivironment, even though
my machine runs on Windows, I am using WSL2 Ubuntu 24.0 as my primary deveoplment Environment. It has been fun
so far learning to operate on a completely different setup for development let alone code in it. Looking forward
to learn much more.
